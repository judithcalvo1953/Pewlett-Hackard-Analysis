# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
This analysis was based on the use of files provided on employees of a fictitious company.  There were six .csv files that had to be uploaded into a new database.  But before creating the database, the analyst drew up an ERD using a website called: QuickDatabase Diagrams.  The image included herein shows the ERD.
